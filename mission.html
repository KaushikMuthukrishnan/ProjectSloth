        <p class="page-body">The marine sloths of South America's Pacific coast became extinct at the end of the Pliocene 
        following the closing of the Central American Seaway; this caused a cooling trend in the coastal waters which killed off 
        much of the area's seagrass (and which would have also made thermoregulation difficult for the sloths, with their slow 
        metabolism).Ground sloths disappeared from both North and South America shortly after the appearance of humans about 
        11,000 years ago. Evidence suggests human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna. Ground sloth 
        remains found in both North and South America indicate that they were killed, cooked, and eaten by humans.
        Climate change that came with the end of the last ice age may have also played a role (although previous similar 
        glacial retreats were not associated with similar extinction rates). Megalocnus and some other Caribbean sloths survived
        until about 5000 years ago, long after ground sloths had died out on the mainland, but then went extinct when humans finally 
        colonized the Antilles.</p>

        <h4 class="chapters">What we strive to do</h4>
        <p class="page-body">The sloths' habitats are shrinking at a dramatic rate. We strive to change this once and for all by
        implementing a revolutionary new technology called "Habithat." This poket sized device is capable of producing a serene retreat 
        where countless sloths can recoup and relax. With the simple push of a button, Habithat's revolutionary computing power will 
        create a virtual universe where the sloths' consciences can be uploaded to. Their consciences will be encoded and later decoded inside 
        the virtual world in order to create their virtual bodies and selves. This technology is in its infancy and may result conscious loss due to data 
        corruption. However the pros clearly outweight the cons.</p>
