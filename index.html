        <article class="page-body">Sloths are a group of arboreal neotropical xenathran mammals. Noted for slowness of movement, they spend most of their 
        lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rain forests of South America and Central America. They are considered 
        to be most closely related to anteaters. There are six extant sloth species in two 
        genera – Bradypus (three–toed sloths) and Choloepus (two–toed sloths). Despite this traditional naming, all sloths actually 
        have three toes on each rear limb, although two-toed sloths have only two digits on each forelimb.The two groups of 
        sloths are from different, distantly related families, and are thought to have evolved their morphology via parallel 
        evolution from terrestrial ancestors. Besides the extant species, many species of ground sloth ranging up to the size 
        of elephants like Megatherium inhabited both North and South America during the Pleistocene epoch. However, they became 
        extinct during the Quaternary extinction event around 12,000 years ago, together with most large bodied animals in 
        the New World. The extinction correlates in time with the arrival of humans, but climate change has also been 
        suggested to have contributed. Members of an endemic radiation of Caribbean sloths formerly lived in the Greater 
        Antilles. They included both ground and arboreal forms which became extinct after humans settled the archipelago 
        in the mid-Holocene, around 6,000 years ago.</article>

        <h4 class="chapters">Physiology</h4>
        <article class="page-body">Sloths have colour vision, but have poor visual acuity. They also have poor hearing. Thus, they rely on their sense of smell and touch to find food.
        Sloths have very low metabolic rates (less than half of that expected for a mammal of their size), and low body temperatures: 30 to 34 °C (86 to 93 °F) when active, and
        still lower when resting. Sloths are heterothermic, meaning their body temperature may vary according to the environment, normally ranging from 25 to 35 °C (77 to 95 °F), 
        but able to drop to as low as 20 °C (68 °F), inducing torpor.The outer hairs of sloth fur grow in a direction opposite from that of other mammals. In most mammals,
        hairs grow toward the extremities, but because sloths spend so much time with their limbs above their bodies, their hairs grow away from the extremities to provide 
        protection from the elements while they hang upside down. In most conditions, the fur hosts symbiotic algae, which provide camouflage from predatory jaguars, ocelots, 
        and harpy eagles. Because of the algae, sloth fur is a small ecosystem of its own, hosting many species of commensal and parasitic arthropods.There are a large number 
        of arthropods associated with sloths. These include biting and blood-sucking flies such as mosquitoes and sandflies, triatomine bugs, lice, ticks and mites. Sloths have 
        a highly specific community of commensal beetles, mites and moths.Species of sloths recorded to host arthropods include: the pale-throated sloth, the brown-throated sloth, 
        and Linnaeus's two-toed sloth. Incidentally, it appears that sloths benefit from their relationship with moths because the moths are responsible for fertilizing algae on 
        the sloth, which provides them with nutrients.</article>

        <article class="page-body">The marine sloths of South America's Pacific coast became extinct at the end of the Pliocene following 
        the closing of the Central American Seaway; this caused a cooling trend in the coastal waters which killed off much of the 
        area's seagrass (and which would have also made thermoregulation difficult for the sloths, with their slow metabolism).

        Ground sloths disappeared from both North and South America shortly after the appearance of humans about 11,000 years ago. Evidence
        suggests human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna. Ground sloth remains found in both North and South
        America indicate that they were killed, cooked, and eaten by humans. Climate change that came with the end of the last ice age 
        may have also played a role (although previous similar glacial retreats were not associated with similar extinction rates).

        Megalocnus and some other Caribbean sloths survived until about 5000 years ago, long after ground sloths had died out on the 
        mainland, but then went extinct when humans finally colonized the Antilles.</article>
